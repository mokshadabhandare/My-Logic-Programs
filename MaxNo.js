To find the maximum number in an array using JavaScript, you can use the `Math.max()` function along with the spread operator (`...`) to pass the array elements as individual arguments. Here's an example code snippet:

```javascript
const numbers = [5, 10, 3, 8, 2];
const maxNumber = Math.max(...numbers);

console.log("The maximum number is: " + maxNumber);
```

In this example, we have an array called `numbers` with some values. By using `Math.max()` with the spread operator, we can find the maximum number in the array. The result will be stored in the `maxNumber` variable. Finally, we can display the maximum number using `console.log()`. Give it a try and let me know if you have any questions!
